Backend repo can be found [here](https://github.com/TyNel/reddit-clone-be)

<p>The main purpose of this project was for me to get familiar writing css on my own without the use of a framework. Practice my javascript and learn new concepts in react.</p>

<p>Features that I would like to implement would be allowing users to join communities so that those communities can be prioritized when viewing posts. Community members and online members count. Filtering when viewing posts by date, location, trending and top. Messaging directly between accounts.

## Features

1. Account creation
2. Community creation
3. Post creation
4. Comment section
5. Vote system for both comments and posts
6. Searchbar for finding communities and posts
